pain in right hip||pain in leg||neuropothy in feet.||trouble sleeping||neuropathy,|!|I had been on Tamoxofin for 5 years. I then took Evista for about 1 1 / 2 years when my doctor put me on Femara because it is more effective. I was fine in the beginning. After two years or so, I started having pain in my right hip and down my leg where it was uncomfortable to walk. I also developed neuropothy in both feet. I did not understand what the problem was. I went to multiple doctors, and no one could figure out what was going on. A year later I was in so much pain that I had trouble sleeping and could barely walk at all. Long story short, it was the Femara. I have been off of it for a year. After several months, I was not feeling that much better, so ended up going to an accupuncturist only becaus I was desperate! The next day my pain was gone which absolutely amazes me. I still have the neuropathy, but I can deal with that. I started last january having a monthly injection of Faslodex which so far has caused me no problems. I almost forgot to respond to this web

joint pain||pain heels||night sweats|!|I have been taking Femara for 5 months. The good news is that I only have another 4 and 1 / 2 years! I have pretty much all the side effects with the exception of depression. I exercise 2 hours 5 times per week and this really helps. My joint pain is very severe. I also have extreme pain in both heels and it often takes 15 to 20 steps before the pain subsides when getting out of bed. The night sweats were the worst! I found a solution in a product called "Chilipad" It is a pad that is placed between the mattress and top sheet. You just set the temperature to your liking and are cool throughout the night. This has been the greatest discovery as there is nothing like a good nights sleep.
joint pain,||muscle pain,||(sleeplessness,||no libido,||hot flashes,||forgetfulness,||shoulder pain.||osteoarthritis||pain|!|I took Tamoxifen for 5 years and Femara for 3. I was having joint and muscle pain, asked my oncologist if I could quit, he agreed. All other symptoms could be attributed to menopause maybe (sleeplessness, no libido, hot flashes, forgetfulness, etc.). Shortly after, I started experiencing extreme shoulder pain. Have been diagnosed with osteoarthritis and am looking at shoulder replacement surgery and am having to give up my job. Doesn't seem possible to have advanced so fast at the age of 50. I also feel like I'm 80 or 90 years old! I suppose Femara helped in the fact that I am still cancer free, but live with extreme pain every day. Massage helps.

In addition I had two types of vaginits two weeks after I started tamoxifen. My doctor said the infections were probably due to change in the PH balance caused by tamoxifen. I am hoping that with Femara the discharge will diminish with time. The are the first two medicines that have caused a bad reaction in me.
gained lbs,||always hot,||leg cramps,||foot cramps,||high blood pressure,||high cholestrol,||blurred vision||problems sleeping.||vision blurred.|!|4 years ago I was put on a 5 year Evista program because I was considered high risk for breast caancer. The reason I came to this web site is becase I have always felt that Evista is the cause for other medical problems that started shortly after starting the Evista an no matter what else I do, I can't seem to get rid of. Since I have been on Evista, I have gained about 20 lbs, I am always hot, I suffer leg and foot cramps, high blood pressure, high cholestrol, blurred vision and problems sleeping. These problems all started after I started taking Evista. My doctor does not acknowledge any of these side effects as being caused by the Evista, but he has given me perscriptions for each of my side effects so now I take 4 additional medications for the side effects and I have had 2 new eye glass perscriptions that does not help when the vision is blurred. I don't know if I would have had these problems anyway but after reading everyone's comments and realizing that I am not crazy in thi

No sleep||night sweats.||leg cramps,||back soreness||insomnia. |!|I took evista for the first time about 15 years ago. It was the worst year of my life. No sleep and constant night sweats. It was close to menopause so I determined the side effects were related. As my osteporosis was not improving with fosomax, I started Evista again about 3 months ago. I have been experiencing terrible leg cramps, back soreness and insomnia. This is the worst drug I have ever taken. The Eli Lilly literature says nominal side effects -- they are not telling the truth.
Hair's thin,||hands numb,|!|Too many side effects to list, felt like i had rheumatoid arthritis for 2-3 years. Hair's thin, hands go numb, I had many symptons you all have had or are having. but, I have to say, either i've learned to adjust to the discomfort, or the symptoms have lessened. My five years is up in September and am so looking forward to going off this drug, but I don't see the docs until January. At my last visit, they said they have FDA approval to continue it for seven years. An option I think I'll pass on
joint pain in hands||joint pain in wrists|!|I too had joint pain in my hands & wrists and almost switched to something else, but then I got braces for my wrists to wear at night, they are for carpal tunnel but they keep my hands & wrists in neutral position at night and I now have very little pain. Over the counter at Walgreens one for each hand they are flesh colored with velcro straps to hold them on and a hole for thumb to stick out they are rigid plastic. If your only pain is in hands try it, this worked for me and it was my only side effect.
leg pain||palpitations.||palpations||leg pain||blurs my vision.|!|Took Evista for several months, experienced excruciating leg pain and heart palpitations. Took myself off this medication in September. The palpations went away first, after a few weeks, but it took three months to get over the pain in my legs, mostly at night. Then I decided I would give it another chance a couple of weeks ago. The palpitations began within a few days and the leg pain started about a couple of days later. I took myself off the medication again last night. This medication also affects, blurs my vision. I will never take another evista pill.
restless nights||forgetfulness(major)|!|I experience restless nights and forgetfulness(major) as I did going through menopause, my cholesterol is up, but my main problem is that my immune system has been severely compromised. I am always sick with whatever is going around. One complaint finishes and next starts. This started within weeks of finishing radiation and starting arimidex. I don't know which of the t / ments would be causing this.I don't take to the bed, but I might have the occasional rest. I was an extremely healthy, fit woman before BC, I had no risk factors other than being 59. I still try to keep my fitness up, but it is impossible to get any routine daily exercise going. Anyone else in the same situation?

The cancer spread to my Colon (primary was never found in my breast). I'm a rare bird. The first year I was put on Tomaxifen and my tumor markers continued to rise. About three months ago I was put on Femara because the tumor came back again in my colon. Since then I've had very noticeable joint, bone and muscle pain (even in feet). I also have chest pain, palpitations. Even though I have a mitral valve I think the medication offsets these symtoms. I wear glasses but my vision seems somewhat more blurred. I even seem to get short term memory losses. I get off the bus everyday and can't see to remember where I parked my car. I'm very fatigued and can't sleep so I have to take a sleeping pill every night (Ambien CR) which usually makes you binge. In the beginning I was getting very bad hot flashes and night sweats but those have gotten better now. Vaginal dryness is the other symptom I have. That something a little
thinning hair.||nails raising from nail beds.|!|I had my cancer 6 yrs ago, at first took Tamoxifen. Then postop after a hip revision I had a mild stroke, the Internist had neglected to take me off of it. "T" is known for clotting problems. Then my Oncologist started me on Arimidex which I took for 4 years. No notable side effects until nearing the end of Arimidex except thinning hair. Then my nails started raising from my nail beds. No one willing to blame Arimidex except me. I researched on this site and saw a similar complaint, not many but enough to apply to be taken off. My nails, although poor quality quickly adhered. Between Tamoxifin and Arimidex I was on 5 yrs, max for suggested use in Canada. I have many aging signs that I don't think are necessarily from the drugs. I am satisfied, why not, so far I have not had a reoccurance of Cancer. I know that this site is Anecdotal reporting but I am thankful for it. I reported my case to the Provincial pharmaseutical provider in our Health Care System and of course my Oncol

Weight gain,||back pain,||hip pain,||leg pain,||leg cramps,||restless leg syndrome,||joint stiffness,||NO libido,||insomnia||hip pain||hip pain|!|I've been taking Evista for four years without problems, I thought. Weight gain, back / hip / leg pain, leg cramps, restless leg syndrome, joint stiffness, NO libido, and insomnia could all be attributed to menopause, worn out lumbar disk, or lousy luck. The hip pain has been severe at times but x-rays and MRI gave no cause...physical therapy didn't help. Four nights ago I borrowed a Darvocet for the hip pain but had coincidentally run out of Evista that day. After four days OFF Evista my hips are better, knees not stiff, feet don't hurt, and I fall asleep easily. Imagine my surprise after doing some research to find that I have MANY of the symptoms others have developed while taking Evista. Hmmm... could it really be this easy?

I have been having great test results from my catscans, bonescan, etc. to this point so I don't have any comparisons to rate against. But do know that all of a sudden - literally overnight- at the 3 week point I felt like I had been run over by a train and / or flattened by a piece of heavy construction roller equipment. Began in the night with chills then the next day every bone and muscle ached, extreme headache and extreme fatigue. I could barely lift my self out of bed which was very scary. Everything hurt - even my knuckles to bend my fingers - I felt that something was very wrong. Until that point I could not tell any difference from taking Tamoxifen for the 2 years that I did. I have a Breast Cancer Drugs book written for Oncology nurses that I had not yet read up on Femara yet... when I did I was actually comf

After taking evista for about 3 months, I noticed deep aching pain in my upper arms and shoulders, along with leg cramps at night. A few months later, the pain in my shoulders and upper arms caused me sleeplessness and increased difficulty raising my arms over my head. Additionally, I could no longer lift my hand weights due to decreased strength in my arms - I stopped taking the drug!! It is now about 4 months later, and I still have some pain in my upper arms, particularly with deep aching pain during the night. However, the strength is returning, but not yet to the "pre-evista" level. I would recommend extreme caution if you are considering this drug, and stop it sooner than I did if you are experiencing side effects.

Took Fareston for 2.5 years w / no noticeable side effects. Drug became unavailable & doctor prescribed Arimidex. After about 6 months on drug, I suddenly experienced severe joint pain in shoulders, knees, feet, neck. I was unable to move about easily and only a steady dosage of Alleve helped with the pain. Work full time and had difficulty dealing with the daily pain, especially in the morning. Shooting pain in knees and feet. Stopped Arimidex 8 months ago and begain taking Glucosamine and coral calcium. After 6 months off Arimidex, the joint pain has subsided and I am able to do mild exercise. On the drug, I could not even swim. I feel the quality of life on Arimidex is very poor, and I decided to reclaim my life. I will leave the outcome and my future in Jehovah's hands.

I missed about a weeks worth while transitioning prescription and felt SO much less stress. I have only experienced mild joint issues, but have had the trigger finger in my ring fingers and hammer toes on middle toes. *** Scares me that bone density scan has come back with negative numbers. Issues other than the bone loss for me are the complete lack of libido and vaginal atrophy / dryness (sex? forget it!). This has affected my marriage in a big way. I also have fatigue and this strange sensation I get in the evenings. Not quite like a hot flash - kind of a tingly fuzzy claustrophobia feeling that starts in the breast area and radiates outward. I do have night sweats, but they are managable. Constantly feel like I dont sleep well. I also have trouble focusing (mentally) and my work has suffered badly as a result. I have a job that requires a lot of time critical work and multitasking and I am always behind. Feel like I am in a haze alo

My doctor recommended that I try Femara again...this time, (in 2008) I took the pill for 2 days and on the third day, I could not get up from my chair for over two hours. I never took the pill again...and, the doctor agreed with me. I recommend this pill for all enemies of the free world. This would tell them, that, we mean business in our search for peace. This pill is more devasting than a roadside bomb...at least when you're gone, you're out of misery. But, having to have pain every day is something you'd wish on your worst enemy. My doctor yielded to my discomfort (a mild word) and, I did not take this pill from Hell, again but, it's still rendering terrible pain. I realize, it's probably out of my system, but, the havoc it has caused is still with me. I have contacted the makers of this Hell-Pill to no avail.

hot flashes||"chemo brain"||can't get enough sleep||walk is painful||bone pain|!|Thankfully, I didn't experience any more hot flashes than I had previously, from early menopause that I experienced due to a hysterectomy. Unfortunately, I did experience some very unpleasant side effects. I was hoping to find my body and brain recovering, becoming stronger and "healthier", regaining a sense of balance after the battle of chemo. Instead, I seem to just be on a downhill slope of increasing and new symptoms. My "chemo brain" doesn't seem to be getting any better. I'm having trouble finding the right words and remembering things. I can't seem to get enough sleep and even fall asleep at my desk and computer. Getting up to walk is SO painful and sometimes I just have to PULL myself up, FORCE a foot to move, and literally WILL my legs to move. I look like I'm twice my age, but once I'm up and going, I walk pretty well - just a bit slower than normal. The bone pain is the worst part of it all and is absolutely excruciating.

I've had upper thigh pain for 3 months, soreness in my toes, and last week I had the most hideous charlie horse in my calf. Now I have pains in my wrists. I was put on a sulfa drug for a bladder infection (the doctor said I had a very small amount of bacteria..he was puzzled as to why I was having so much discomfort) and related to him that I had this funny "tingling" in my pelvic area. To top it off, I have been experiencing alot of heartburn. Now that I read all the comments posted here, I stopped taking Evista immediately and informed my doctor. I just hope the side effects go away. Where can we get info on how long this stuff will stay with us????

I had trouble sleeping well (insomnia) due to inability to relax at night though feeling extremely tired. What didn't I experience on this medication!

The hot flashes have been severe. I would be constantly breaking out in a sweat and feeling as if I was on fire. Breaking out in a sweat ten times during a shift at work was very inconvenient and uncomfortable. I was soaking through my clothes. These sweats and hot flashes interferred with sleep. I was only able to sleep for short periods and then would be awake the rest of the night. I couldn't get comfortable. After five months I began developing arthritis in my hands. My left thumb has been very painful now for four months. Both hands feel stiff and hurt. I also had transient joint pain in the lower back, hips, and shoulders. Around this same time I began having terrible fatigue. I was a marathon runner when I was dx'd with cancer and continued to run through the chemo and before and after my mastectomy / reconstruction surgery. During months 6 through 8 on Tamoxifen, I began to

hot flashes||back pain||joint pain in knees||depression|!|I will be satisfied if it continues to keep me cancer free. I have been taking the drug for 2 1 / 2 years. The hot flashes are brief and tolerable. I have back pain and joint pain in my knees that has necessitated treatment by an orthopedic surgeon. He sees knee replacement down the road, although he does not know enough about Arimidex to attribute the condition to it. Overall, I do not have the mobility and agility that I had pre cancer treatment. I don't know if my depression is due to the continuous pain or the drug. Fortunately, I have had no weight gain from it.

Five years after cancer discovery am still alive, but have no idea if Arimidex is the reason. Perhaps will never know. Complained to doctors at cancer clinic and Astra Zeneca immediately about bone and muscle pain. Doctors had never heard of these side effects but AZ had. Files were started on my situation but I have to call them, they do not sontact me for updates. Every year I go off it for 1 month to obtain some relief. I am going to go off of it for 2 months this time for more conclusive results. I have spent thousand and thousands of dollars on weeekly physio, massage therapy and active release therapy through my chiropractor (which works the best). None are long term relief. I seemed to have some relief a year ago but now realize muscle spasms replaced some of the pain and continue today. My left side is the troublesome side with concentration in my neck and shoulder.

Have had a series of joint aches, carpal tunnel, frozen shoulder, and other symptoms that could be attributed to Arimidex but may just have to do with being 55. But the most frustrating side effect has been the effect on my weight - and I KNOW that's the Arimidex. Two years before I was diagnosed, I lost 55 pounds through diet and exercise. I know that the level of fitness I had reached helped me bounce back from surgery and through chemo. Now, on Arimidex, my body seems primed to gain. I can lose if I drastically reduce calories and up the exercise, but as soon as anything interrupts that regimen, I start gaining again. There is no stasis - I'm either dieting frantically or gaining.

In November I noticed that I was having a hard time swallowing. By December I could hardly swallow at all and the pain was awful. An Endoscopy showed that Evista had burned ulcers in my esophogus. I now have to take Prilosec every day or the ulcers come back.
